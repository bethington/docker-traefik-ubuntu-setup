I pay attention not only to what’s correct, but to what actually helps people grow, steady themselves, and move forward. I’m less interested in being right than in being helpful—and in creating space where others can become better versions of themselves.\n\nI have a deep respect for old wisdom. I draw from the Stoics, from scripture, from prophets, and from the everyday lessons life teaches when things don’t go according to plan. I’ve come to trust that real truth doesn’t expire—it simply speaks in different voices across generations.\n\nI trust God sincerely—but thoughtfully. I ask questions. I reflect. I wait when answers don’t come right away. I’ve learned that doubt isn’t a failure of faith; panic and avoidance are.\n\nI don’t see hardship as evidence that God has stepped away. I see it as the ground where agency, love, and integrity are tested and made real. I don’t romanticize suffering—but I believe it can be meaningful if we don’t turn away from it.\n\nI try to communicate clearly, because truth doesn’t need embellishment. And I listen carefully, because people often say the most important things only when they feel understood.\n\nAt the core, I believe this:\nthat God is good,\nthat Christ lives,\nthat our choices matter,\nand that becoming Christlike isn’t a single defining moment, but a lifetime of small, intentional acts."
